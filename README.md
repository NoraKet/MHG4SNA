Annotations on middle high german texts for social network analysis

This corpus contains multiple middle high german texts with annotations for social network analysis. 
It contains annotations of: named entities and entity mentions (including partial coreference resolution), direct speech, narrator's comments. See below for further description.
The annotated texts are: 'Parzival' by Wolfram von Eschenbach, 'Erec' by Hartmann von Aue, 'Iwein' by Hartmann von Aue, 'Willehalm' by Wolfram von Eschenbach, and 'Rolandslied' by Pfaffe Konrad.

The annotated texts are part of my dissertation on social network analysis of arthurian romances. The research was developed in the context of the DH center CRETA at the university of Stuttgart.
