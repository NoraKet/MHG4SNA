The gexf files can be used to import the data to gephi, https://gephi.org/. 
The occurrences of the characters are based on the annotation and grounding of entities (categorie PER). 
A relation between entities is based on co-occurrence (whenever two or more entities co-occur in a segment, they have a relation; with more relations, the intensity of their relation grows).

Embedded entities are excluded. 
Entities mentioned in direct speech (DS) or in comments (EK) can optionally be selected or deselected. 
These optional filters are indicated in the name of the files.
E.g. file erec_gephi_noEK_noEK2 exludes all entity references that are annotated within a comment section (EK and EK2), but includes entity references that are part of a direct speech section.

For more information on the annotations see README in MHG4SNA.
